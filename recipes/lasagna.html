    <h4>Seriously, this will be best Lasagna you'll ever eat!</h4>

    <p>This is a recipe that's been passed down in my family for generations. I'll keep it short and sweet for you. You only really need a couple ingredients.</p>

    <ul class="listing">
        <li>2 cans of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of oregano</li>
        <li>1 lb of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tsp of crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>2 packets of McCormick Mushroom Spaghetti seasoning</li>
        <li>Onion powder or diced onion</li>
        <li>Green pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>16 oz Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>10 oz bag of fresh mozerella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="simple">The prep is pretty simple. If you've never cooked lasagna before that's okay. Just follow the directions below:</p>

    <ol class="listing">
        <li>Brown the meat in a pan or skillet, add onion or onion powder and diced green pepper.</li>

        <li>Add both packets of seasoning mix.</li>
        <li>Stir until mixed. Simmer.</li>
