    <h4>The best old fashioned you'll ever drink!</h4>

    <p>This is a recipe that's been my favorite after a hard week's work where I'm wanting to just relax, or show off for guests.</p>

    <ul class="listing">
        <li>4 oz of your favorite bourbon or rye. Personally I recommend Bulliet or Buffalo Trace</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp aromatic bitters</li>
        <li>1 sugar cube</li>
        <li>An orange slice or peel for garnishing</li>
        <li>Ice is optional if you'd like it on the rocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The prep is simple. Just follow the directions below:</p>

    <ol class="listing">
        <li>Place the sugar cube into the bottom of the glass and drip the aromatic bitters on top of it.</li>
        <li>Begin gently mashing the sugar cube into the bottom of the glass.</li>
        <li>Pour in your whisky of choice.</li>
        <li>Stir until sugar content is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Twist orange or orange peel into the glass.</li>
        <li>Place ice into the glass gently to avoid splashing and losing any of your deliciious drink.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hope you guys enjoy! Let me know what you think!</p>
